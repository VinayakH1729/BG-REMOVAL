# Authentication Requirements Implementation

## Summary
The app now requires user authentication before allowing access to the background removal feature. Users must sign in with Clerk before they can upload and process images.

## Changes Made

### Client-Side Protection
1. **Header Component** (`src/components/Header.jsx`)
   - Added authentication check before file processing
   - Shows "Sign in to Upload" when not authenticated
   - Disabled upload button styling when not signed in
   - Updated description text based on auth status

2. **Upload Component** (`src/components/Upload.jsx`)
   - Same authentication checks as Header
   - Prevents file processing without authentication
   - Opens sign-in modal when unauthenticated users try to upload

3. **Result Page** (`src/pages/Result.jsx`)
   - Added authentication guard that redirects to home if not signed in
   - Shows loading spinner while checking authentication status

4. **Navbar Component** (`src/components/Navbar.jsx`)
   - Disabled Server/Local mode toggle when not authenticated
   - Visual feedback with opacity and cursor changes

5. **Steps Component** (`src/components/Steps.jsx`)
   - Updated first step to "Sign in and upload"
   - Improved descriptions for all steps

### Server-Side Protection
1. **Authentication Middleware** (`Server/middlewares/auth.js`)
   - Basic Bearer token check for API protection
   - Returns 401 for unauthenticated requests
   - Note: In production, should verify Clerk JWT properly

2. **Image Routes** (`Server/routes/imageRoutes.js`)
   - Added `requireAuth` middleware to `/remove-bg` endpoint
   - Ensures server-side protection even if client is bypassed

### API Request Updates
- Both Header and Upload components now send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- Uses Clerk's `getToken()` method to obtain valid JWT
- Gracefully handles missing tokens

## User Experience
- **Unauthenticated users** see "Sign in to Upload" buttons that trigger Clerk's sign-in modal
- **Upload buttons** are visually disabled (gray) when not signed in
- **Mode toggle** is disabled until user signs in
- **Result page** redirects to home if accessed without authentication
- **Clear messaging** throughout the UI about authentication requirements

## Security Notes
- Client-side checks are for UX only - server-side middleware provides actual security
- Current server auth is basic - production should implement proper JWT verification
- Both local (browser) and server background removal modes require authentication

## Testing
All components compile without errors and maintain existing functionality while adding authentication requirements.
